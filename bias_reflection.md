# ⚖️ Ethics in Personalized Medicine – Bias Reflection

## Overview

Personalized medicine leverages AI to tailor treatments based on individual patient data, such as genetic profiles. While this enhances precision, it raises critical ethical concerns—especially around dataset bias and fairness.

## Potential Biases in Cancer Genomic Atlas Data

1. **Underrepresentation of Ethnic Groups**:  
   Many genomic datasets, including TCGA, are disproportionately composed of samples from individuals of European descent. This results in AI models that are less accurate for minority populations, potentially leading to unequal treatment recommendations.

2. **Gender and Age Gaps**:  
   Some cancer subtypes may have more data for a specific gender or age range. This skews model performance and may lead to suboptimal outcomes for underrepresented demographics (e.g., young adults or elderly patients).

3. **Geographic Sampling Bias**:  
   Data is often collected from high-resource medical centers in developed countries. As a result, the trained AI may perform poorly in low-resource settings where clinical practices and patient profiles differ.

## Fairness Strategies

1. **Diverse Training Data**:  
   Incorporate genomics from diverse populations (ethnicity, gender, geography) to improve model generalizability. Collaborate globally to balance data representation.

2. **Bias Detection Tools**:  
   Use fairness assessment frameworks like **IBM AI Fairness 360** to detect and measure bias in the model’s predictions across different subgroups.

3. **Transparent Reporting**:  
   Clearly document dataset composition, model limitations, and known biases in all clinical AI deployments. Promote explainable AI (XAI) for transparency in decision-making.

4. **Stakeholder Involvement**:  
   Involve ethicists, clinicians, and patient advocacy groups in the design and deployment of AI models to ensure responsible use.

## Conclusion

Without conscious efforts to detect and mitigate bias, AI in personalized medicine risks widening healthcare disparities. Fairness tools and inclusive data practices are essential to ensure ethical, equitable, and accurate treatment recommendations.
