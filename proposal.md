# ðŸŒ¾ Smart Agriculture System â€“ AI + IoT Proposal

## Objective

Design a smart agriculture solution using AI and IoT technologies to optimize crop monitoring and predict crop yield. The system will provide farmers with actionable insights to increase productivity, reduce waste, and adapt to climate variability.

---

## System Overview

The system integrates multiple environmental sensors with an AI model that analyzes real-time data to predict crop yield and trigger alerts (e.g., irrigation needs or disease risk).

---

## Required IoT Sensors

- **Soil Moisture Sensor** â€“ monitors water levels in soil
- **Temperature Sensor** â€“ tracks ambient temperature
- **Humidity Sensor** â€“ monitors air moisture
- **Light/UV Sensor** â€“ measures sunlight exposure
- **pH Sensor** â€“ detects soil acidity/alkalinity
- **Rain Gauge** â€“ detects rainfall intensity
- **COâ‚‚ Sensor** (optional) â€“ monitors carbon concentration for greenhouse scenarios

---

## AI Model Description

- **Input Features**: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light level, pH, etc.
- **Model Type**: Supervised regression or classification (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Target Output**: Predicted crop yield category (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
- **Training Data**: Historical crop yield records + sensor logs

---

## Benefits

- Real-time monitoring of critical soil and climate parameters
- Predictive alerts to prevent crop failure
- Optimized irrigation schedules â†’ saves water
- Scalable to other use cases (e.g., pest prediction)

---

## Deployment Environment

- Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi / Arduino (for sensor data collection)
- AI Inference: Local edge device or cloud-based model API
- Dashboard: Web/mobile UI for farmers with charts, alerts, and historical trends
